## 🔧 API Simulation

The application includes a comprehensive mock API that simulates a FastAPI backend:

### Endpoints Simulated
- `POST /auth/login` - User authentication
- `POST /auth/register` - User registration
- `GET /users` - List users with pagination and search
- `POST /users` - Create new user
- `PUT /users/:id` - Update user
- `DELETE /users/:id` - Delete user
- `GET /items` - List items with filtering
- `POST /items` - Create new item
- `PUT /items/:id` - Update item
- `DELETE /items/:id` - Delete item

### Features
- Realistic API delays (300-1000ms)
- Proper error handling and validation
- Pagination support
- Search and filtering capabilities
- JWT token simulation

## 🚀 Deployment Ready

### Production Build
The application is optimized for production deployment:
- Minified and optimized bundles
